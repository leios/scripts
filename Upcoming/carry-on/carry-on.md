song: Already there...
[This is my new computer case that I call the "carry-on computer," codename: swiss cheese because, well...

The point is that this is a full desktop computer that fits into a carry-on case.
This one is fully air cooled because I was afraid of the TSA taking a liquid-cooled machine.
If I'm honest, I'm still afraid the TSA will take this one, but I guess we'll see in a week when I fly again.

You might be wondering why I even need something like this.
Well, I don't have a particularly strong laptop and will regularly need a more powerful machine for weekend trips. | show laptop
I have also moved a lot over the past few years.] | Just me with the case
This means that once or twice a month I have needed to package my computer into a large case that is padded with foam and then lug around all the parts necessary to run the computer at a new location. | packaging and rolling out

It's been a huge pain.

[The obvious solution would be to buy a new, more powerful laptop, but I've had 3 different laptops over the course of my life and am tired of buying machines that I can't fix myself. | show laptop
More than that, this was way less expensive.
Because I had all the desktop parts already, it was about $3-400 for all the case supplies compared to over $2000 for a laptop with comparable specs.] | me with case

With this case, all parts are replaceable, so if something breaks, I don't have to buy a new machine, I can just replace that one part. | show case, on
There's less overall waste and it should be more cost-effective in the long run. | show case, on

[Even though this is one of the coolest things I have ever made, I still made a bunch of mistakes while building it...] | me with case
like how the hole for the back plate was too large, so I needed to create a new one with balsa wood. | show from back, rotating.
I also really messed up when placing the mounting screws for the motherboard. | Show initial footage of buiding it
If I were to build this again, I would probably get an open-frame ATX test bench, mount that first, then figure out how to place the back plate from there. | Show amazon, then rebuild for motherboard

For this design, I sprung for the Nanuk 935 instead of other cases specifically because it was thick enough to fit some small desktop fans, but I really screwed up trying to figure out the right layout for the venting holes. | Case closed to open -> point to fan -> angle to see outside of case
Also, because there are wheels, I had to work around the weird plastic bulges inside the case, meaning that there was only one possible orientation for the power supply and that the GPU had to sit on top if it. | point to buldges, then power supply, then GPU
This also meant that I couln't use my more powerful Noctua fans, as then there was no way to plug anything into the GPU if I did that. | flip to case on table -> case with fan, but circle the problem -> case with stock cooler
Again, no water cooling because of the TSA, so I had to go back to the stock AMD cooler.

[With that said, I'm not really noticing any huge temperature spikes under heavy load, possibly because of the open case design, but it's still a shame I couldn't find a better cooling solution yet.] | me with case

I also spent hours and hours trying to find a monitor that would fit the case and ended up with one that I am not too happy with but works for now. | open to monitor, view from front
The main problem here is that most manufacturers only put the screen size and the size of the entire monitor with the stand attached and neither of these measurements were what I needed. | Show example
[I suppose the case screen will be a second monitor most of the time, so I probably won't replace it in the near future, but this was another pain-point I wish I had a better solution to.] | me with case and second monitor next to it.

The only other issue I have with the case is that the front-plate is not mounted properly and that I didn't really know where to put the power and reset buttons. | Show mount

[I guess I'm explaining all of this in the case that you want to build one yourself.
It's no where near as difficult as I thought it would be and I think it's really cool, so it's a fun weekend project to do when you have the time.]

If you want one of these, but don't trust yourself to make it on your own, let me know in the comment section below. | rotating
I like the idea enough that I am willing to try to kickstart it if there is market demand, so please also like and share this video if you want to buy something like this. | open, close, turn on, open, close

[Honestly, there is a lot of work to do before something like this would be marketable.
The biggest problem with this project is that I needed to buy an existing case and modify it for desktop use, so...
I would like to create a new case that is specifically designed for this purpose, probably made to be more inline with a traditional chasis.
I would also need to do a bunch of performance tests with different computer hardware and under different conditions, but again... I'm willing to give all that a try if I see demand.]

What I have here is the first iteration of a potential product, [and as everyone knows, the first iteration of anything you make will always be really rough, but I still love it to death and would love to see more people with something like this.] | Show watching myself say this on youtube? Close case afterwards

Anyway, that's all for now... If you like this content and want to see it continue in the future, please consider supporting me on either github sponsors or patreon...
