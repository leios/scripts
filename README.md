Scripts for LeiosOS

If you are interested in helping provide translations for any video, please go to the CommunityContributions directory and pick the video title that you would like to help with.

From there, open the file with English subtitles and either edit that file or create a new file with your preferred language working from the English base.
The `captions.md` has a link in the timestamp above each line to the appropriate location on youtube.
The `misc.md` has the title and description for the chosen language.
