# Title
What is Monte Carlo?

# Description
Here's a video describing programming magic: Monte Carlo integration!

It's a super cool algorithm that is used all the time (in physics at least), so it was good to cover it here. We'll have more algorithms coming up, so be sure to check them out as they come along!

I also did a small write-up on integrating the Batman Curve:

As always, the simulations were done live on:
