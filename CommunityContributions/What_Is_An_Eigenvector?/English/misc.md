# Title
What is an Eigenvector?

# Description
Hey guys, this is a quick introductory video to what an eigenvector is and how it relates to eigenvalues. It'll be used a lot later on, so it's good to know!

Outside of that, I'm going to *try* to be way more consistent with my video uploads. It's been forever since my last one and there are reasons for that, but they are not worth mentioning here. 

All of the simulations done on this channel can be seen live on:

Or after the fact on:

Which is my second channel for streams and stuff. I've got a bit of a backlog of videos to make, so hopefully everything goes smoothly from here on out!

I am now way more active on twitter, too, so feel free to follow me there (no pressure):

Outside of that, the background music is from Josh Woodward (sped up 1.5 times). He's a super cool guy, so go check out his stuff, if you can:

I think that's all for now, so have a great day, night, afternoon, morning... whatever time it happens to be your time and I'll see you next time!

NOTE: In the visualization of eigenvectors, I plotted only vectors that passed through the origin on (0,0,0), this does not need to be the case! So long as the points are in the right direction, you will have the right vector and you will see only stretching!
