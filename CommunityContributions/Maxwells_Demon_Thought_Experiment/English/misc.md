#Title
Maxwell's Demon Thought Experiment

#Description
Be sure to check out my twitch channel, simuleios (5 - 7AM JST):
http://www.twitch.tv/simuleios

And, of course, the github repo where this was coded up:
https://github.com/leios/simuleios

... And the site this is now hosted on:
http://leios.github.io/

Outside of that, there are a few things I would like to mention about these simulations:

1. Some of the simulations shown for diffusion were actually truncated simulations of other Maxwell demon simulations. If it seems like some of the particles were bouncing on the interior wall when they shouldn't have been... well, I am sorry about that! Also note that none of these simulations truly reached equilibrium. Sorry. I didn't let the simulations run long enough!

2. Let me know if you want to see me actually coding this up on simuleios. I will add a maxwell's demon playlist filled with unlisted videos of the process, if you want!

3. Let me know if you have any further questions. Seriously, I love hearing them!

Want more information and my answers are not good enough? Well, there's always wikipedia:

And... I think that's about it. Thanks for watching and I'll see you next time!
