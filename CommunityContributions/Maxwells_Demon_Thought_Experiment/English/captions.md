[00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h0m0s)
let's talk about a thought experiment

2
[00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:08,400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h0m2s)
Maxwell's demon so a particle is a point

3
[00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h0m6s)
in space and pretty much anything can be

4
[00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,990](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h0m8s)
described as a particle I could be a

5
[00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h0m10s)
particle the son could be a particle but

6
[00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h0m12s)
mostly when we think about particles we

7
[00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,859](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h0m15s)
think about the molecules and the air

8
[00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h0m17s)
around us and there are a whole lot of

9
[00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,699](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h0m19s)
them

10
[00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,439](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h0m20s)
in fact in twenty 2.4 liters of air at

11
[00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h0m23s)
standard temperature and pressure

12
[00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h0m25s)
there are 6.022 times 10 to the 23rd

13
[00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,239](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h0m28s)
particles that is a phenomenally high

14
[00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,550](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h0m31s)
number I mean

15
[00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,410](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h0m33s)
it's unfathomable how large this number

16
[00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h0m35s)
is and even though we have billions of

17
[00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,820](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h0m37s)
um trillions upon quadrillions of

18
[00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:45,480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h0m39s)
particles all bouncing along and against

19
[00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h0m41s)
us at any given moment in time we act as

20
[00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h0m45s)
if they don't exist at all and it's

21
[00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h0m46s)
because we're used to it you know we've

22
[00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,449](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h0m48s)
we've always lived in one atmosphere of

23
[00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:58,170](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h0m51s)
pressure and if that isn't cool I don't

24
[00:00:54,449 --> 00:01:01,050](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h0m54s)
know what is speaking of cool let's take

25
[00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,629](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h0m58s)
a moment to talk about temperature you

26
[00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,339](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h1m1s)
see temperature can be described as the

27
[00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:07,320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h1m3s)
velocity of all of these little

28
[00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:09,630](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h1m5s)
particles the faster the particles are

29
[00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,610](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h1m7s)
moving the hotter everything is and the

30
[00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,890](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h1m9s)
slower they're moving the colder

31
[00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h1m11s)
everything is in fact this is the

32
[00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h1m13s)
difference between a solid liquid and

33
[00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,610](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h1m15s)
gas in a gaseous state all of the

34
[00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,930](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h1m18s)
particles are moving incredibly fast and

35
[00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,030](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h1m20s)
they're bumping against each other and

36
[00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:27,060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h1m21s)
the wall is in kind of exerting pressure

37
[00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,799](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h1m24s)
on everything but in a solid the

38
[00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,770](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h1m27s)
particles aren't kind of cold and they

39
[00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,930](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h1m28s)
huddled together for warmth now let's

40
[00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h1m31s)
say we took two different gases at

41
[00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,890](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h1m33s)
different temperatures one that's

42
[00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,439](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h1m35s)
incredibly hot or all of the particles

43
[00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,299](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h1m37s)
are moving incredibly quickly and

44
[00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,310](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h1m39s)
another that's kind of cool where the

45
[00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h1m42s)
particles maybe aren't moving around so

46
[00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,579](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h1m44s)
quickly they're kind of sluggish they

47
[00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,770](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h1m45s)
don't really want to move around and

48
[00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h1m47s)
let's say we put both of these types of

49
[00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,090](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h1m49s)
particles in a box together so that they

50
[00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,430](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h1m51s)
kind of interact with each other well in

51
[00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h1m54s)
this case the two different temperature

52
[00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:01,049](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h1m56s)
gases will reach what we call an

53
[00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:03,119](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h1m58s)
equilibrium where the temperature will

54
[00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h2m1s)
be somewhere in between the temperature

55
[00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h2m3s)
of the two other gases and as this

56
[00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:11,860](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h2m5s)
since we cannot stop this from happening

57
[00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:14,410](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h2m7s)
it just will always happen but is there

58
[00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,210](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h2m11s)
any way to maybe split up these two

59
[00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:18,280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h2m14s)
temperatures again so if we take some

60
[00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:20,830](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h2m16s)
sort of distribution some sort of

61
[00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h2m18s)
equilibrium where we're at some stable

62
[00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:25,090](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h2m20s)
temperature can we maybe split all of

63
[00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:27,630](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h2m23s)
the faster particles to go one way and

64
[00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:31,990](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h2m25s)
all the colder particles to go another

65
[00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:33,460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h2m27s)
well no we can't but if we could we

66
[00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:36,250](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h2m31s)
would be implementing what is known as

67
[00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:38,530](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h2m33s)
Maxwell's demon essentially imagine a

68
[00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h2m36s)
giant rectangular prism with some sort

69
[00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:42,520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h2m38s)
of partition in the middle that means

70
[00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h2m40s)
nothing at the start of the simulation

71
[00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h2m42s)
if we put two different types of gases

72
[00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,030](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h2m45s)
in there one that's hot and one that's

73
[00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h2m46s)
cold the two gases will form an

74
[00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:53,050](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h2m49s)
equilibrium like we said before and

75
[00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:56,410](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h2m51s)
they'll kind of intermingle and do their

76
[00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:58,180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h2m53s)
thing but let's say at some point we

77
[00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:00,580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h2m56s)
decide that this partition should do

78
[00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:03,370](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h2m58s)
something right the partition

79
[00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h3m0s)
should force all of the hot particles to

80
[00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h3m3s)
go to one side and all the cold

81
[00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,430](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h3m5s)
particles to go to another by simply

82
[00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h3m7s)
saying you're not allowed to pass

83
[00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:15,370](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h3m9s)
through me the partition unless you're

84
[00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,550](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h3m12s)
moving at a particular speed and in this

85
[00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h3m15s)
way we've separated the hot and cold

86
[00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:23,320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h3m17s)
gases and made what is essentially an

87
[00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,989](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h3m20s)
oven and a refrigerator in one the

88
[00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:29,260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h3m23s)
entity that is physically separating the

89
[00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:31,570](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h3m25s)
two gases was thought by Maxwell to be

90
[00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:35,050](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h3m29s)
some sort of demon and hence the name

91
[00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:37,480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h3m31s)
Maxwell's demon as a bit of a side note

92
[00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:40,420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h3m35s)
have you ever noticed how time always

93
[00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h3m37s)
seems to move forward like no matter

94
[00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:45,040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h3m40s)
what we do we cannot seem to get it to

95
[00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h3m42s)
move back have you ever wondered why

96
[00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h3m45s)
that is well there are a number of

97
[00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,270](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h3m48s)
reasons for this one of which happens to

98
[00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:54,700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h3m50s)
be known as the second law of

99
[00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:57,760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h3m52s)
thermodynamics it's known to some people

100
[00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:00,340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h3m54s)
as an arrow of time a directionality in

101
[00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,010](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h3m57s)
time a basically points us towards the

102
[00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:05,950](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h4m0s)
direction time has to move and you might

103
[00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:08,470](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h4m3s)
be wondering why why does time have to

104
[00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:10,870](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h4m5s)
move forward well think about Maxwell's

105
[00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:13,660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h4m8s)
even think about running that simulation

106
[00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,670](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h4m10s)
in Reverse if we have two different

107
[00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,359](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h4m13s)
colored balls let's say red balls and

108
[00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,729](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h4m15s)
blue balls and they're in two different

109
[00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,739](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h4m17s)
and then we kind of put the two boxes

110
[00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:24,680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h4m19s)
together and shake up the box as fast as

111
[00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:27,530](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h4m21s)
we can the red and blue balls will kind

112
[00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,330](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h4m24s)
of mix together right this is the second

113
[00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:31,759](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h4m27s)
law of thermodynamics it states that no

114
[00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:34,729](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h4m29s)
matter how ordered a system is when we

115
[00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,449](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h4m31s)
evolve it thermodynamically it will

116
[00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:40,310](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h4m34s)
become more chaotic than it was before

117
[00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:42,879](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h4m37s)
the second law highlights an interesting

118
[00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:45,289](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h4m40s)
thermodynamic principle irreversibility

119
[00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:48,139](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h4m42s)
basically once things are shaken up they

120
[00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:50,419](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h4m45s)
don't often become unshaken and it is

121
[00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:54,590](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h4m48s)
for this reason that time must move in

122
[00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:56,719](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h4m50s)
one direction forward and it is also for

123
[00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:58,280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h4m54s)
this reason that Maxwell's demon is one

124
[00:04:56,719 --> 00:05:00,379](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h4m56s)
of the coolest physical thought

125
[00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,210](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h4m58s)
experiments because it's not a matter of

126
[00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:03,979](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h5m0s)
throwing cold particles to one side of

127
[00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:05,750](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h5m2s)
the box and hot particles to another

128
[00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:08,060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h5m3s)
side of the Box it's a matter of

129
[00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:10,009](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h5m5s)
reversing the irreversible

130
[00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:14,000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h5m8s)
taking an arrow of time and flipping it

131
[00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:16,009](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h5m10s)
on his head and Maxwell's demon is one

132
[00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h5m14s)
of the many reasons why I think physics

133
[00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:22,009](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h5m16s)
is absolutely awesome anyway thanks guys

134
[00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,759](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h5m20s)
so much for watching and I will see you

135
[00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:27,500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h5m22s)
next time

toodles cool you're still here

137
[00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h5m27s)
because I kind of forgot to mention

138
[00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:33,229](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h5m28s)
something important during that last

139

video you just watched and that's that

140
[00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:38,289](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h5m33s)
the simulations you just saw we're live

141
[00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:40,520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h5m35s)
coded by me on twitch.tv slash

142
[00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:42,589](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h5m38s)
simulators there will be a link in the

143
[00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,270](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h5m40s)
description basically I get up at 5

Standard Time I don't know what time

146
[00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:48,979](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h5m46s)
that is your time but it's like 3

147

Standard Time in the US and I've been

149
[00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:54,740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h5m50s)
coding for about two hours with whoever

150
[00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,839](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h5m53s)
the heck feels like joining me and it's

151
[00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,719](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h5m54s)
been a lot of fun and I hope that maybe

152

153
[00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:03,409](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h5m59s)
point in time but that's about it I hope

154
[00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,699](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5niDIoptyIU#t=0h6m2s)
you enjoyed the video and let me know
