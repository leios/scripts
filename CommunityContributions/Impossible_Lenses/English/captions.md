[00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h0m0s)
let's draw a spherical lens and shoot it

2
[00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:05,520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h0m1s)
with a bunch of rays of light

3
[00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,710](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h0m3s)
afterwards we'll see about what we

4
[00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h0m5s)
expect some sort of focusing with

5
[00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,150](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h0m7s)
spherical aberration as we modify the

6
[00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,790](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h0m10s)
refractive index the focusing of light

7
[00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h0m12s)
moves along the optical axis here I

8
[00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h0m14s)
think it's important to note that the

9
[00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,039](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h0m16s)
speed of light is inversely proportional

10
[00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,170](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h0m17s)
to the index of refraction of the media

11
[00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,359](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h0m20s)
it is currently moving through this

12
[00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,570](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h0m22s)
means that in a higher refractive index

13
[00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,250](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h0m24s)
light will be moving slower now don't

14
[00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,990](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h0m27s)
get me wrong this is pretty cool but

15
[00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h0m29s)
most people have seen something like it

16
[00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h0m30s)
before let's imagine instead of having

17
[00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h0m33s)
some constant index for our lens having

18
[00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,350](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h0m36s)
some index that varies as a function of

19
[00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,030](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h0m38s)
the radius of the lens in this case we

20
[00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,070](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h0m40s)
could imagine the light bending in some

21
[00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,309](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h0m42s)
unusual ways and creating some

22
[00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,890](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h0m44s)
interesting lenses for example the

23
[00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:51,989](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h0m47s)
Luneberg lens here the index our

24
[00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h0m49s)
refraction at any given point within the

25
[00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:57,030](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h0m51s)
lens is equal to the square root of 2

26
[00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,879](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h0m54s)
minus the points position over the

27
[00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h0m57s)
lenses total radius squared no matter

28
[00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:04,290](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h0m59s)
where the light enters it will Bend and

29
[00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,650](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h1m2s)
focus on the optical axis on the other

30
[00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,990](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h1m4s)
side of the lens now here's where things

31
[00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,090](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h1m7s)
start getting a little weird in essence

32
[00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,490](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h1m9s)
we can plug in any function of R for our

33
[00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h1m12s)
index of refraction however some of

34
[00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,869](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h1m14s)
these lenses cannot be created in an

35
[00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,990](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h1m16s)
experimental laboratory which means that

36
[00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:24,600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h1m18s)
from now on we might be doing the

37
[00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,430](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h1m21s)
impossible let's start with a seemingly

38
[00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,439](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h1m24s)
simple case where the index of

39
[00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,990](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h1m26s)
refraction at any given point within the

40
[00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:33,200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h1m28s)
lens is equal to the lenses radius over

41
[00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:36,570](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h1m30s)
that points distance from the origin

42
[00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,210](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h1m33s)
when light enters it actually cannot

43
[00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:42,299](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h1m36s)
escape and instead swirls further and

44
[00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,790](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h1m39s)
further into the depths of the lens now

45
[00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,009](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h1m42s)
of course this lens is impossible to

46
[00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h1m44s)
create the closer we get to the center

47
[00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,869](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h1m47s)
of the lens the higher the refractive

48
[00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,299](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h1m48s)
index is and at precisely the origin the

49
[00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:56,340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h1m51s)
refractive index is well infinite

50
[00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,170](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h1m54s)
meanwhile the highest index of

51
[00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,049](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h1m56s)
refraction we can find in nature is

52
[00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,969](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h1m58s)
germanium at roughly 4 and the highest

53
[00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:04,890](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h2m1s)
positive refractive index we can create

54
[00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:07,920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h2m2s)
in the laboratory is thirty eight point

55
[00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,170](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h2m4s)
six with metamaterials now for some fun

56
[00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,730](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h2m7s)
let's modify our refractive index

57
[00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h2m10s)
function by multiplying by some

58
[00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,230](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h2m11s)
arbitrary parameter

59
[00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h2m13s)
and wrapping an error function around it

60
[00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,159](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h2m15s)
now let's sweep through all of the

61
[00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h2m17s)
values for this parameter from zero to

62
[00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:23,000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h2m19s)
two you'll notice that initially all of

63
[00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h2m21s)
the rays are reflected but as the

64
[00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,590](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h2m23s)
parameter increases eventually more and

65
[00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,989](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h2m25s)
more rays are introduced to the lens as

66
[00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,790](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h2m27s)
the first few rays entered they swirl

67
[00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:34,730](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h2m29s)
around the lens in some crazy fashion

68
[00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:36,799](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h2m31s)
before exploding out of the side but as

69
[00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:39,049](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h2m34s)
the parameter increases in value the

70
[00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:41,629](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h2m36s)
index of refraction becomes more or less

71
[00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:45,200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h2m39s)
constant until eventually the parameter

72
[00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:47,590](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h2m41s)
is around to here it's almost as if the

73
[00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h2m45s)
light never entered a lens to begin with

74
[00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:51,889](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h2m47s)
now let's try some arbitrary sinusoidal

75
[00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,810](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h2m50s)
function and watch to see what happens

76
[00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:59,780](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h2m51s)
as we sweep through different

77
[00:02:53,810 --> 00:03:01,849](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h2m53s)
frequencies okay maybe that wasn't the

78
[00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,590](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h2m59s)
best idea but we can actually see the

79
[00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:06,349](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h3m1s)
light bending around areas of higher

80
[00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:08,659](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h3m3s)
amplitude which is pretty cool but

81
[00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:11,659](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h3m6s)
probably one of the coolest theoretical

82
[00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:12,829](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h3m8s)
lenses is a so-called invisible lens for

83
[00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:15,290](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h3m11s)
which there will be a link in the

84
[00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:16,939](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h3m12s)
description for more information now I

85
[00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,229](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h3m15s)
didn't come up with this lens but it's

86
[00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:20,569](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h3m16s)
pretty interesting

87
[00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:22,669](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h3m18s)
basically any light that enters a lens

88
[00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:25,400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h3m20s)
leaves on the other side of the lens

89
[00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:27,709](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h3m22s)
with the same angle it came in with it's

90
[00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,109](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h3m25s)
almost as if the light never entered the

91
[00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:33,290](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h3m27s)
lens at all and hence the name the

92
[00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:35,090](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h3m30s)
invisible lens now on Twitch we've tried

93
[00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,650](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h3m33s)
a number of different lenses and if

94
[00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h3m35s)
you're interested in any function in

95
[00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h3m36s)
particular feel free to leave it in the

96
[00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,699](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h3m38s)
comment section below and if we get

97
[00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,979](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h3m39s)
enough of them I can create another

98
[00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:44,959](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h3m40s)
video with viewer-requested lenses a

99
[00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:47,000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h3m42s)
little bit later for now I'd like to

100
[00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtR6mdpl5M#t=0h3m44s)
thank you for watching I'll see you next

101
