# Title
Impossible lenses

# Description
We have been working on a geometrical optics visualizer on https://www.twitch.tv/simuleios . I figured it was about time to show you some cool lenses!

If you have fool ideas for functions to try, put them in the comments below!

As always, the code is available on github.com: https://github.com/leios/simuleios/tree/master/geometrical_optics
And all the streams are on:

INVISIBLE LENS:
Almost all of my invisible lens information came from the following paper:
