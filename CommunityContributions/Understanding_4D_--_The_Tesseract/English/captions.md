[00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,730](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h0m0s)
so the other day I was doing my daily

2
[00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:07,560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h0m1s)
browsing of Wikipedia when I found this

3
[00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:09,780](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h0m4s)
it represents a four dimensional cube or

4
[00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,030](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h0m7s)
tesseract undergoing a rotation along

5
[00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:15,719](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h0m9s)
both the XY and Z W planes

6
[00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:18,029](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h0m12s)
simultaneously this completely boggled

7
[00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:19,800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h0m15s)
my mind and I just had the simulated

8
[00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:21,900](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h0m18s)
first of all let me point out that the

9
[00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,939](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h0m19s)
visualization is not four dimensional

10
[00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,070](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h0m21s)
rather it is a representation of four

11
[00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h0m23s)
dimensions in three dimensions and it is

12
[00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h0m26s)
then rendered on a two-dimensional

13
[00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,090](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h0m27s)
screen what does this mean well let's

14
[00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,219](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h0m30s)
take a cube it's a perfectly fine 3d

15
[00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h0m33s)
object I mean it's no four dimensional

16
[00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h0m35s)
cube or anything but it'll do for now we

17
[00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,239](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h0m38s)
can represent this cube as a series of

18
[00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:46,320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h0m39s)
planes or cross-sections cut along the

19
[00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,570](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h0m42s)
XY or z axes obviously the 2d planes are

20
[00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,539](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h0m46s)
not actually 3d cubes rather they are

21
[00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:54,690](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h0m48s)
representations of 3d objects in a 2d

22
[00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,149](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h0m51s)
space if we take two planes one at Z

23
[00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h0m54s)
equals negative 0.5 and another at Z

24
[00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,649](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h0m57s)
equals positive 0.5 and connect these

25
[00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h0m59s)
two planes with lines that represent all

26
[00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:07,080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h1m1s)
other possible planes along that axis we

27
[00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,850](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h1m4s)
once again see a cube this is kind of

28
[00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,490](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h1m7s)
the visualization we'll be doing for our

29
[00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,850](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h1m8s)
4d tesseract if we take a cross-section

30
[00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:17,729](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h1m11s)
along the W dimension let's say at W

31
[00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:20,130](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h1m14s)
equals a negative 0.5 we'll find a

32
[00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:22,320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h1m17s)
three-dimensional cube and if we move

33
[00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:25,740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h1m20s)
along the W dimension from W equals

34
[00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,829](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h1m22s)
negative 0.5 to positive 0.5 will see

35
[00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:31,290](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h1m25s)
that this cube scales in size now just

36
[00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:32,670](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h1m28s)
like in the 3d case the lines connecting

37
[00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,950](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h1m31s)
these cubes represent

38
[00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,530](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h1m32s)
the sum of all cross-sections between

39
[00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,780](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h1m34s)
the two cubes so this is not a perfect

40
[00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h1m37s)
representation but it's as close as we

41
[00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h1m39s)
can get so we have a representation of a

42
[00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h1m42s)
tesseract a four-dimensional cube now

43
[00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,619](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h1m45s)
let's rotate it in Cartesian XY

44
[00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h1m47s)
coordinates we can rotate a system with

45
[00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:54,360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h1m49s)
a simple rotation matrix in four

46
[00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h1m52s)
dimensions this doesn't really change we

47
[00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h1m54s)
can see a rotation in the XY plane

48
[00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,110](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h1m56s)
simply by tacking an identity matrix

49
[00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,210](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h1m58s)
onto the end of our rotation matrix so

50
[00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h2m1s)
now let's get a little crazy what

51
[00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:08,789](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h2m3s)
happens if instead of rotating in the XY

52
[00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,619](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h2m5s)
plane we rotate instead in the Z W plane

53
[00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:12,750](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h2m8s)
well this happens

54
[00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:15,390](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h2m10s)
we cannot represent the W plane very

55
[00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:17,400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h2m12s)
well so it looks like one cube rotates

56
[00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h2m15s)
around and engulfs the other cube in an

57
[00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h2m17s)
endless struggle for dominance now it

58
[00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,910](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h2m20s)
doesn't stop there because both of our

59
[00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,459](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h2m22s)
rotation matrices have two dimensions

60
[00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h2m23s)
free at any given moment we may actually

61
[00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,390](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h2m26s)
perform a special type of rotation known

62
[00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h2m28s)
as a double rotation by rotating in both

63
[00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:36,269](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h2m30s)
the XY and Z W planes at the same time

64
[00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,879](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h2m33s)
and with this we can finally replicate

65
[00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:41,150](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h2m36s)
the animation on Wikipedia but wait

66
[00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,900](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h2m38s)
there is something I missed a second ago

67
[00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,549](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h2m41s)
projections if we have a

68
[00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,190](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h2m42s)
four-dimensional point how do we

69
[00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:49,530](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h2m44s)
represent it in 3d well the obvious

70
[00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:51,690](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h2m47s)
answer is to take a 3 by 4 matrix and

71
[00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,970](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h2m49s)
multiply by that but if we take any

72
[00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:56,700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h2m51s)
arbitrary matrix say the identity matrix

73
[00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:59,069](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h2m53s)
with zeroes along the W dimension the

74
[00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,110](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h2m56s)
rotation doesn't look quite right this

75
[00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:03,750](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h2m59s)
is because most tesseract depictions use

76
[00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,489](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h3m1s)
stereographic projections which resemble

77
[00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,989](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h3m3s)
the act of holding a light source behind

78
[00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:09,239](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h3m5s)
an object and checking its shadow

79
[00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:11,459](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h3m6s)
against the screen of course for this

80
[00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:13,650](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h3m9s)
analogy to work for projections from 40

81
[00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:15,480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h3m11s)
to 3d we have to assume that our screen

82
[00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,639](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h3m13s)
can somehow hold three-dimensional

83
[00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h3m15s)
objects but let's ignore that for now

84
[00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:22,769](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h3m17s)
basically all we need to do is divide

85
[00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:25,530](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h3m19s)
every element in the matrix by LW minus

86
[00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:28,530](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h3m22s)
W where LW is the position of the light

87
[00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,849](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h3m25s)
source on the W axis and W is a position

88
[00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,430](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h3m28s)
of the point itself that we are

89
[00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:35,459](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h3m29s)
projecting now here's the cool part by

90
[00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:37,739](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h3m32s)
varying our LW parameter the location of

91
[00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:38,940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h3m35s)
our light source along the W axis we can

92
[00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:41,160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h3m37s)
see dramatically different

93
[00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,889](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h3m38s)
visualizations even though the rotations

94
[00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h3m41s)
themselves have not changed so there you

95
[00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:46,260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h3m43s)
have it

96
[00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,569](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h3m44s)
how does simulate a tesseract undergoing

97
[00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,579](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h3m46s)
double rotation I found this incredibly

98
[00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:53,989](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h3m48s)
cool and I hope you did too thanks for

99
[00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:53,989](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGO12Z5Lw8s#t=0h3m50s)
watching and I'll see you next time
