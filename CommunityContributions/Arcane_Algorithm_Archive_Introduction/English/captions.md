[00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,210](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h0m0s)
learning is something I've always

2
[00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:07,440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h0m1s)
enjoyed but I've always had to do it in

3
[00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:08,849](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h0m3s)
my own way and on my own time that's

4
[00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h0m7s)
part of the reason I created this

5
[00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:13,559](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h0m8s)
YouTube channel to begin with and so far

6
[00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h0m10s)
it's been tremendously successful that

7
[00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:17,850](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h0m13s)
said I've always thought something was

8
[00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h0m15s)
missing and now I think I finally found

9
[00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:23,400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h0m17s)
what that is the arcane algorithm

10
[00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,230](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h0m20s)
archive it's literally an archive of all

11
[00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,029](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h0m23s)
the arcane algorithms covered on this

12
[00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,349](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h0m25s)
channel and I wanted to be written in a

13
[00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:30,300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h0m27s)
way that's both accessible and

14
[00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,189](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h0m28s)
descriptive now here's the thing it is

15
[00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h0m30s)
incredibly far from being anywhere near

16
[00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,030](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h0m32s)
complete to be honest it's going to

17
[00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h0m34s)
start a little underwhelming as the

18
[00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,899](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h0m36s)
algorithms we cover start to build into

19
[00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h0m37s)
bigger and bigger things it's currently

20
[00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,170](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h0m39s)
available in get book which is great

21
[00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h0m41s)
because it allows users like yourself to

22
[00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,070](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h0m43s)
comment whenever things don't make sense

23
[00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,629](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h0m44s)
or if there's a typo or something on top

24
[00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h0m47s)
of that it has a corresponding github

25
[00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:52,410](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h0m48s)
repository so if you want to you can

26
[00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,629](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h0m50s)
submit pull requests now here's the

27
[00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,670](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h0m52s)
thing I didn't want any one language to

28
[00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:58,410](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h0m54s)
dominate the algorithm archive however

29
[00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,850](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h0m56s)
it would be nearly impossible for me to

30
[00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,829](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h0m58s)
implement every algorithm and every

31
[00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,870](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h0m59s)
language known to man so here's where

32
[00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m1s)
you guys come in every time we implement

33
[00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,110](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m3s)
a new algorithm for the archive I would

34
[00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,490](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m5s)
love it if you guys could implement it

35
[00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,170](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m7s)
in your favorite language and submit it

36
[00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,850](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m8s)
to me via pull request Twitter whatever

37
[00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,619](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m10s)
you want to submit it to me with with

38
[00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,659](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m11s)
time I feel like the algorithm archive

39
[00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,159](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m13s)
could become a great resource for people

40
[00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m15s)
who want to learn algorithms in the

41
[00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m17s)
future so here's how it's going to go at

42
[00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,900](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m18s)
least for the start first we're going to

43
[00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,759](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m20s)
have to choose an algorithm and this

44
[00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,439](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m21s)
will be done via Twitter poll or maybe

45
[00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,780](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m23s)
even YouTube comments depending on how

46
[00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m25s)
it goes then we'll move to twitch where

47
[00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,229](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m27s)
we'll stream the initial coding some

48
[00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,270](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m29s)
animations and writing of the algorithm

49
[00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:34,920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m31s)
archive from there we'll go to YouTube

50
[00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,350](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m33s)
where I'll ask for implementations from

51
[00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,329](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m34s)
you guys and that's basically it

52
[00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,710](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m37s)
basically I just wanted to let you guys

53
[00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:42,899](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m39s)
know about something that we've started

54
[00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,119](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m40s)
and I'm incredibly excited about it so

55
[00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:46,680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m42s)
here's the thing the algorithm archive

56
[00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,899](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m45s)
seems to combine nearly all of my

57
[00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m46s)
passions writing research openness

58
[00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:53,159](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m48s)
programming it's all done and I really

59
[00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,750](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m51s)
want to give it a shot so from now on

60
[00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m53s)
all videos that have some sort of

61
[00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,390](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m54s)
algorithm

62
[00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,670](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m55s)
or computational purpose we'll have an

63
[00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,590](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m57s)
algorithm archive article to go with

64
[00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h1m59s)
them eventually all these articles will

65
[00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,270](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h2m1s)
add up into an entire book which will be

66
[00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,670](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h2m3s)
hopefully enjoyable and descriptive at

67
[00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h2m6s)
the same time that said I want to thank

68
[00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h2m8s)
you so much for watching and I will see

69
[00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,210](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h2m10s)
you next time

70
[00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,309](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er6opt2yJWw#t=0h2m10s)
toodles
