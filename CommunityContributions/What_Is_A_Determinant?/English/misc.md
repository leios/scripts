What is a determinant?

# Description
How do we interpret the determinant intuitively? Well, here is one way! 

This video was requested by Thecalculatorman on reddit!

A few quick notes: 
* There are limitations to this way of thinking about the determinant, but for the most part it's solid for 3 and 2D objects. 
* Finding the area of the transformed unit cube is the same as finding the area of the parallelpiped, just a little easier to explain. In hindsight, I should have added this definition too.
* There is a lot I skipped over, like how to perform the determinant. That wasn't the point of this video. I wanted to give people an intuitive feel for what the determinant was doing underneath.
